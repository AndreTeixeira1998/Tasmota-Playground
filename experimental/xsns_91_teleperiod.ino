  EXPERIMENTAL DRIVER - PROVIDED FOR TINKERERS BUT NO SUPPORT PROVIDED

  How to use: Simply copy file into sonoff folder and compile - The driver will then be included automatically
              Please note that if you use more than one experimental driver you will need to rename the 91
              value to a different value e.g. 92-99
  
  xdrv_91_teleperiod.ino - Append current teleperiod to SENSOR JSON as follows:

  19:43:55 MQT: tele/sonoff/SENSOR = {"Time":"2019-01-17T19:43:55","ANALOG":{"A0":0},"TelePeriod":{"teleperiod":10,"telecurrent":10}}
